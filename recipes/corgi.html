      Originally bred to herd cattle, sheep, and horses, the Pembroke Welsh
      Corgi is an active and intelligent dog breed. Easy to train and eager to
      learn, Pembrokes are great with children and other pets, and you can find
      them in four different coat colors and markings.

      Even though these are purebred dogs, you may find them in the care of
      shelters or rescue groups. Remember to adopt! Don’t shop if you want to
      bring a dog home.
    </p>

      Adaptable and loving with the whole family, Corgis can fit into just about
      any household, whether it’s an apartment or large home with a yard.
      However, they do have quite a bit of energy for a small dog. They’ll need
      plenty of walks and active play sessions. You might be surprised by how
      quickly these short-legged pups can move! For humans who can meet the
      breed’s needs, the Pembroke will make an excellent family companion, even
      for novice pet parents.
